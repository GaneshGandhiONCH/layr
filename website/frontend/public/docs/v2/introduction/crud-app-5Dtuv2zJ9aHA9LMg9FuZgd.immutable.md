### CRUD App

#### Coming Soon

This page will explain how to build a simple CRUD app with Layr.

Unfortunately, writing tutorials takes a lot of time, and the Layr project is currently handled by a [single person](https://mvila.me) who has to work for customers to make a living and is also starting a new ambitious project, which will be based on Layr.

This tutorial will come for sure, but please be patient.

If you cannot wait and feel adventurous, you can figure out how to build an app with Layr by checking out:

- The ["Hello, World!"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/hello-world) introductory app.
- The pretty exhaustive ["Reference"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/reference) section.
- Some [examples](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/introduction#examples) of simple full-stack apps _(including a CRUD app)_ built with Layr.
