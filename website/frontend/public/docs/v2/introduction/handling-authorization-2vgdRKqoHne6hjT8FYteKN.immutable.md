### Handling Authorization

#### Coming Soon

This tutorial will expand the ["Hello, World!"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/hello-world) app to show you how Layr handles user authorization.

Unfortunately, writing tutorials takes a lot of time, and the Layr project is currently handled by a [single person](https://mvila.me) who has to work for customers to make a living and is also starting a new ambitious project, which will be based on Layr.

This tutorial will come for sure, but please be patient.

If you cannot wait and feel adventurous, you can figure out how to handle authorization with Layr by checking out:

- The [`WithRoles()`](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/reference/with-roles) mixin in the "Reference" section.
