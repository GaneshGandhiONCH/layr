### Coming Soon

This section will introduce the basic concepts of Layr, such as:

- Components
- Controlled attributes and methods
- Cross-layer inheritance
- Storage
- Routes and wrappers

However, writing documentation takes time, and the Layr project is currently developed by a [single person](https://mvila.me) who has to work for customers to make a living and is also starting a new ambitious project, which will be based on Layr.

So, more documentation will come for sure, but please be patient.

If you cannot wait and feel adventurous, you can figure out how to build an app with Layr by checking out:

- The ["Hello, World!"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/hello-world) introductory app.
- The pretty exhaustive ["Reference"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/reference) section.
- Some [examples](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/introduction#examples) of simple full-stack apps built with Layr.
