### Guides

#### Coming Soon

This section will contain some guides explaining how to achieve the most common tasks and features with Layr, such as:

- Local development
- Layouts and pages
- Data fetching and storage
- Authentication
- Testing
- Deployment

Unfortunately, writing documentation takes a lot of time, and the Layr project is currently handled by a [single person](https://mvila.me) who has to work for customers to make a living and is also starting a new ambitious project, which will be based on Layr.

More documentation will come for sure, but please be patient.

If you cannot wait and feel adventurous, you can figure out how to build an app with Layr by checking out:

- The ["Hello, World!"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/hello-world) introductory app.
- The pretty exhaustive ["Reference"](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/reference) section.
- Some [examples](https://layrjs.com/docs/v2/introduction/introduction#examples) of simple full-stack apps built with Layr.
