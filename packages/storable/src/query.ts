/**
 * @typedef Query
 *
 * A plain object specifying the criteria to be used when selecting some components from a store with the methods [`StorableComponent.find()`](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/storable#find-class-method) or [`StorableComponent.count()`](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/storable#count-class-method).
 *
 * #### Basic Queries
 *
 * ##### Empty Query
 *
 * Specify an empty object (`{}`) to select all the components:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find all the movies
 * await Movie.find({});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### Single Attribute Query
 *
 * Specify an object composed of an attribute's name and value to select the components that have an attribute's value equals to a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Japanese movies
 * await Movie.find({country: 'Japan'});
 *
 * // Find the unreleased movies
 * await Movie.find({year: undefined});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### Multiple Attributes Query
 *
 * You can combine several attributes' name and value to select the components by multiple attributes:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Japanese drama movies
 * await Movie.find({country: 'Japan', genre: 'drama'});
 * ```
 *
 * #### Basic Operators
 *
 * Instead of a specific value, you can specify an object containing one or more operators to check whether the value of an attribute matches certain criteria.
 *
 * ##### `$equal`
 *
 * Use the `$equal` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is equal to a specific value. This is the default operator, so when you specify a value without any operator, the `$equal` operator is used under the hood:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Japanese movies
 * await Movie.find({country: {$equal: 'Japan'}});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({country: 'Japan'});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$notEqual`
 *
 * Use the `$notEqual` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is different than a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the non-Japanese movies
 * await Movie.find({country: {$notEqual: 'Japan'}});

 * // Find the released movies
 * await Movie.find({year: {$notEqual: undefined}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$greaterThan`
 *
 * Use the `$greaterThan` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is greater than a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies released after 2010
 * await Movie.find({year: {$greaterThan: 2010}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$greaterThanOrEqual`
 *
 * Use the `$greaterThanOrEqual` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is greater than or equal to a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies released in or after 2010
 * await Movie.find({year: {$greaterThanOrEqual: 2010}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$lessThan`
 *
 * Use the `$lessThan` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is less than a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies released before 2010
 * await Movie.find({year: {$lessThan: 2010}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$lessThanOrEqual`
 *
 * Use the `$lessThanOrEqual` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is less than or equal to a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies released in or before 2010
 * await Movie.find({year: {$lessThanOrEqual: 2010}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$in`
 *
 * Use the `$in` operator to check whether the value of an attribute is equal to any value in the specified array:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that are Japanese or French
 * await Movie.find({country: {$in: ['Japan', 'France']}});
 *
 * // Find the movies that have any of the specified identifiers
 * await Movie.find({id: {$in: ['abc123', 'abc456', 'abc789']}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### Combining several operators
 *
 * You can combine several operators to check whether the value of an attribute matches several criteria:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies released after 2010 and before 2015
 * await Movie.find({year: {$greaterThan: 2010, $lessThan: 2015}});
 * ```
 *
 * #### String Operators
 *
 * A number of operators are dedicated to string attributes.
 *
 * ##### `$includes`
 *
 * Use the `$includes` operator to check whether the value of a string attribute includes a specific string:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have the string 'awesome' in their title
 * await Movie.find({title: {$includes: 'awesome'}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$startsWith`
 *
 * Use the `$startsWith` operator to check whether the value of a string attribute starts with a specific string:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have their title starting with the string 'awesome'
 * await Movie.find({title: {$startsWith: 'awesome'}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$endsWith`
 *
 * Use the `$endsWith` operator to check whether the value of a string attribute ends with a specific string:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have their title ending with the string 'awesome'
 * await Movie.find({title: {$endsWith: 'awesome'}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$matches`
 *
 * Use the `$matches` operator to check whether the value of a string attribute matches the specified [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions):
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have a number in their title
 * await Movie.find({title: {$matches: /\d/}});
 * ```
 *
 * #### Array Operators
 *
 * A number of operators are dedicated to array attributes.
 *
 * ##### `$some`
 *
 * Use the `$some` operator to check whether an array attribute has an item equals to a specific value. This is the default operator for array attributes, so when you specify a value without any array operator, the `$some` operator is used under the hood:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have the 'awesome' tag
 * await Movie.find({tags: {$some: 'awesome'}});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({tags: 'awesome'});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$every`
 *
 * Use the `$every` operator to check whether an array attribute has all its items equals to a specific value:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have all their tags equal to 'awesome'
 * await Movie.find({tags: {$every: 'awesome'}});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$length`
 *
 * Use the `$length` operator to check whether an array attribute has a specific number of items:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have three tags:
 * await Movie.find({tags: {$length: 3}});
 *
 * // Find the movies that don't have any tag:
 * await Movie.find({tags: {$length: 0}});
 * ```
 *
 * #### Logical Operators
 *
 * The logical operators allows you to combine several subqueries.
 *
 * ##### `$and`
 *
 * Use the `$and` operator to perform a logical **AND** operation on an array of subqueries and select the components that satisfy *all* the subqueries. Note that since **AND** is the implicit logical operation when you combine multiple attributes or operators, you will typically use the `$and` operator in combination with some other logical operators such as [`$or`](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/query#or) to avoid repetition.
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Japanese drama movies
 * await Movie.find({$and: [{country: 'Japan'}, {genre: 'drama'}]});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({country: 'Japan', genre: 'drama'});
 *
 * // Find the movies released after 2010 and before 2015
 * await Movie.find({$and: [{year: {$greaterThan: 2010}}, {year: {$lessThan: 2015}}]});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({year: {$greaterThan: 2010, $lessThan: 2015}});
 *
 * // Find the Japanese movies released before 2010 or after 2015
 * await Movie.find({
 *   $and: [
 *     {country: 'Japan'},
 *     {$or: [{year: {$lessThan: 2010}}, {year: {$greaterThan: 2015}}]}
 *   ]
 * });
 *
 * // Same as above, but we have to repeat the country to remove the $and operator
 * await Movie.find({
 *   $or: [
 *     {country: 'Japan', year: {$lessThan: 2010}},
 *     {country: 'Japan', year: {$greaterThan: 2015}}
 *   ]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$or`
 *
 * Use the `$or` operator to perform a logical **OR** operation on an array of subqueries and select the components that satisfy *at least* one of the subqueries.
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that are either Japanese or a drama
 * await Movie.find({$or: [{country: 'Japan', {genre: 'drama'}]});
 *
 * // Find the movies released before 2010 or after 2015
 * await Movie.find({$or: [{year: {$lessThan: 2010}}, {year: {$greaterThan: 2015}}]});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$nor`
 *
 * Use the `$nor` operator to perform a logical **NOR** operation on an array of subqueries and select the components that *fail all* the subqueries.
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that are not Japanese and not a drama
 * await Movie.find({$nor: [{country: 'Japan', {genre: 'drama'}]});
 * ```
 *
 * ##### `$not`
 *
 * Use the `$not` operator to invert the effect of an operator.
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the non-Japanese movies
 * await Movie.find({country: {$not: {$equal: 'Japan'}}});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({country: {$notEqual: 'Japan'}});
 *
 * // Find the movies that was not released in or after 2010
 * await Movie.find({year: {$not: {$greaterThanOrEqual: 2010}}});
 *
 * // Same as above, but in a short manner
 * await Movie.find({year: {$lessThan: 2010}});
 * ```
 *
 * #### Embedded Components
 *
 * When a query involves an [embedded component](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/embedded-component), wrap the attributes of the embedded component in an object:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the movies that have a '16:9' aspect ratio
 * await Movie.find({details: {aspectRatio: '16:9'}});
 *
 * // Find the movies that have a '16:9' aspect ratio and are longer than 2 hours
 * await Movie.find({details: {aspectRatio: '16:9', duration: {$greaterThan: 120}}});
 * ```
 *
 * #### Referenced Components
 *
 * To check whether a component holds a [reference to another component](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/component#referencing-components), you can specify an object representing the [primary identifier](https://layrjs.com/docs/v1/reference/primary-identifier-attribute) of the referenced component:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Tarantino's movies
 * const tarantino = await Director.get({slug: 'quentin-tarantino'});
 * await Movie.find({director: {id: tarantino.id}});
 * ```
 *
 * Wherever you can specify a primary identifier, you can specify a component instead. So, the example above can be shortened as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * // Find the Tarantino's movies in a short manner
 * const tarantino = await Director.get({slug: 'quentin-tarantino'});
 * await Movie.find({director: tarantino});
 * ```
